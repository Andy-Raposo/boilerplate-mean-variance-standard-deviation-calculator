# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This is the repository holding the solution to the first of five freeCodeCamp projects for the Data Analysis with Python certificate, made with VSCode (through GitPod). In the mean_var_std.py file the solution can be seen, with commentary on how it works. The goals of the project were solved using the instructions given in the following link: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator
